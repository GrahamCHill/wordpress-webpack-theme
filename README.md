# WordPress Webpack Theme Starter
A WordPress theme that shows how to use webpack to add Javascript files to the theme.


You can use the following command where and when it is necessary to bundle your JavaScript code for use with your theme,
assuming you have added your JavaScript Libraries using the node package manager `npm`
```bash
npx webpack 
```
This is a simple example of how you can use webpack to extend the functionality of WordPress themes, making it easier to
pull in 3rd party JavaScript libraries. Free for anyone to use as long as they follow the requirements of WordPress's 
licenses, use it as a starting point, or to learn how to integrate external Javascript Libraries more easily into your 
WordPress theme.
